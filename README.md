## Overview

Like its companion project, **[Shapez-MIP-Router](https://github.com/jiahao-0204/Shapez2-MIP-Router)**, **Shapez2-MIP-Miner** applies Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) with the Gurobi optimiser to design asteroid-mining layouts that maximise extraction throughput while respecting in-game constraints.

### How to use
1. put screenshot into `/images`
2. edit `path` in `main.py` to point to screenshot
3. `left click` + `right click` to box a repeating element
4. `q` to confirm selection
5. wait for optimizer to run
6. result it shown


### Current Progress Update
> **Status: work in progress â€“ expect rapid changes.**

## Roadmap

- [x] image recognition for importing astroid layouts
- [ ] add yaml file to expose settings
- [ ] better readme (include instruction of git clone, how to star XD, python command etc)
- [ ] better window layout
- [ ] store output to folder
- [ ] spit out shapez blueprint
