## Overview

Like its companion project, **[Shapez-MIP-Router](https://github.com/jiahao-0204/Shapez2-MIP-Router)**, **Shapez2-MIP-Miner** applies Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) with the Gurobi optimiser to design asteroid-mining layouts that maximise extraction throughput while respecting in-game constraints.
